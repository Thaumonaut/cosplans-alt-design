## Next Steps

Now that the test environment is complete:

1. **Start Building Features**
   - Implement authentication
   - Build project management
   - Create task system

2. **Write Tests As You Go**
   - Follow test-first development
   - Write E2E test ‚Üí Fail ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Pass
   - Use factories and POMs from infrastructure

3. **Monitor CI/CD**
   - Check GitHub Actions on every push
   - Review flaky test reports
   - Maintain 80%+ coverage

4. **Refer to Documentation**
   - `TESTING.md` - Developer guide
   - `docs/TEST_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` - Detailed setup instructions
   - `tests/quarantine/README.md` - Flaky test management

---

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during setup:

1. **Verification script fails**
   ```bash
   bun test:verify
   # Review specific check that failed
   ```

2. **Supabase connection errors**
   ```bash
   # Test credentials manually
   curl <SUPABASE_TEST_URL>/rest/v1/
   ```

3. **GitHub Actions not running**
   - Check .github/workflows/ files exist
   - Verify secrets are at repository level (not environment)
   - Re-run failed workflows after fixing

4. **Staging deployment fails**
   - Check build logs for errors
   - Verify environment variables are set
   - Test build locally: `bun run build`

**Need Help?** Review `docs/TEST_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` for detailed troubleshooting.

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating a cosplay project tracking application from Next.js to SvelteKit. The application currently uses React components, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. The migration should preserve all existing functionality while leveraging SvelteKit's features and ecosystem.

## Glossary

- **Source_Application**: The existing Next.js cosplay project tracking application
- **Target_Application**: The new SvelteKit application with equivalent functionality
- **Migration_System**: The process and tooling used to convert components and features
- **UI_Components**: Reusable interface elements (buttons, cards, forms, etc.)
- **Route_Structure**: The application's navigation and page organization
- **State_Management**: How application data and user interactions are handled
- **Build_System**: The compilation and bundling process for the application
- **Component_Library**: The collection of UI components (currently Radix UI + custom components)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate the application framework from Next.js to SvelteKit, so that I can leverage SvelteKit's performance benefits and development experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Migration_System SHALL convert all existing React components to equivalent Svelte components
2. THE Target_Application SHALL maintain identical visual appearance and user interface layout
3. THE Target_Application SHALL preserve all existing functionality including navigation, forms, and data display
4. THE Build_System SHALL use SvelteKit's native build process instead of Next.js
5. THE Target_Application SHALL maintain TypeScript support throughout the codebase

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace React-specific dependencies with Svelte equivalents, so that the application uses appropriate libraries for the new framework.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Migration_System SHALL replace Radix UI components with equivalent Svelte UI library components
2. THE Target_Application SHALL maintain Tailwind CSS for styling without modification
3. THE Migration_System SHALL convert React hooks and state management to Svelte stores and reactivity
4. THE Target_Application SHALL replace Next.js routing with SvelteKit's file-based routing system
5. THE Migration_System SHALL update all component imports and dependencies to use Svelte equivalents

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve the existing project structure and organization, so that the codebase remains maintainable and familiar.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Target_Application SHALL maintain the same directory structure for pages and components where possible
2. THE Migration_System SHALL preserve component naming conventions and file organization
3. THE Target_Application SHALL maintain the same routing structure and URL patterns
4. THE Migration_System SHALL preserve TypeScript interfaces and type definitions
5. THE Target_Application SHALL maintain the same asset organization and public file structure

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure all interactive features work correctly after migration, so that users experience no loss of functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Target_Application SHALL maintain all form functionality including validation and submission
2. THE Target_Application SHALL preserve all navigation and routing behavior
3. THE Target_Application SHALL maintain all modal dialogs and overlay interactions
4. THE Target_Application SHALL preserve all data display and filtering capabilities
5. THE Target_Application SHALL maintain all responsive design and mobile compatibility

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update the build and development configuration, so that the application uses SvelteKit's tooling and optimization features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Build_System SHALL use SvelteKit's Vite-based build process
2. THE Target_Application SHALL maintain hot module replacement during development
3. THE Build_System SHALL generate optimized production builds with SvelteKit
4. THE Target_Application SHALL maintain TypeScript compilation and type checking
5. THE Migration_System SHALL update package.json scripts to use SvelteKit commands

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure proper error handling and loading states, so that the application provides good user experience during the migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Target_Application SHALL maintain all existing error boundaries and error handling
2. THE Target_Application SHALL preserve loading states and skeleton components
3. THE Migration_System SHALL convert React Suspense patterns to SvelteKit equivalents
4. THE Target_Application SHALL maintain proper error pages and fallback components
5. THE Target_Application SHALL preserve all accessibility features and ARIA attributes

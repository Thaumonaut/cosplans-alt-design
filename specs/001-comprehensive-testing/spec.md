# Feature Specification: Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure

**Feature Branch**: `001-comprehensive-testing`  
**Created**: 2025-10-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "create robust testing (unit, e2e, etc) for all features of this application that are currently planned"

**Constitution Alignment**: This feature directly supports Constitution Principle IV (MVP First, Test-Driven Development - NON-NEGOTIABLE) which requires writing tests BEFORE implementation. It establishes the testing infrastructure and test suites for all MVP Core features defined in the Feature Scope Matrix (Constitution v1.2.0, Section: Feature Scope Matrix).

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-26

- Q: How should test data be isolated to prevent interference between concurrent test runs and ensure test reproducibility? → A: Use separate database schemas/namespaces per test run (strong isolation, allows true parallelism)
- Q: How should the system detect and handle flaky tests to maintain the "zero flaky tests" success criterion? → A: Auto-retry with flagging and quarantine (retry up to 3 times, but flag flaky tests for investigation and move to quarantine suite)
- Q: Should the test environment be deployed automatically for each test run or use a persistent shared environment? → A: Persistent shared staging environment (single long-running test environment used by all test runs - fast but requires careful test data isolation)
- Q: What should be the timeout limits for different test types and how should timeouts be handled? → A: Tiered timeouts with warnings (Unit: 5s, Integration: 30s, E2E: 2min per test; warning at 80% threshold)
- Q: Which pages and components should be prioritized for visual regression testing in the MVP to achieve the 95%+ accuracy target? → A: All 60+ components individually (comprehensive but high maintenance burden)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Critical User Journey E2E Tests (Priority: P1)

As a **QA engineer** or **developer**, I need **automated end-to-end tests for all critical user journeys** so that **we can verify MVP features work correctly and prevent regressions when making changes**.

**Why this priority**: Constitution Principle IV mandates test-first development. The Project Status Review identifies 0% E2E test coverage for critical journeys as a HIGH severity blocker. These tests validate the five most critical user flows that must work for MVP launch.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the E2E test suite against a deployed application (test or staging environment) and verifying all critical user journeys pass.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the E2E test infrastructure is set up, **When** tests for authentication flows are executed, **Then** all authentication tests (signup, login, logout, password reset) pass successfully
2. **Given** a user visits the application, **When** the E2E test simulates project creation workflow, **Then** the test verifies the project appears in the project list and can be viewed
3. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** E2E tests simulate task management workflows, **Then** tasks can be created, assigned, and marked complete
4. **Given** team functionality exists, **When** E2E tests run team creation scenarios, **Then** personal teams are auto-created and private teams can be created with members
5. **Given** resource management features, **When** E2E tests add resources (props, materials, outfits), **Then** resources are created and linked to projects correctly

---

### User Story 2 - Component Unit Tests (Priority: P2)

As a **developer**, I need **unit tests for all reusable components** so that **I can refactor components confidently and catch regressions early in development**.

**Why this priority**: Unit tests provide fast feedback during development and catch bugs before E2E tests. The project already has ~10 component tests; this story expands coverage to all UI components and stores.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the unit test suite (`vitest run`) and verifying all component tests pass with adequate coverage.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a UI component library with 60+ components, **When** unit tests are run, **Then** all base UI components (Button, Card, Input, Select, etc.) have passing tests
2. **Given** feature components exist (ProjectCard, CharacterCreationForm, etc.), **When** unit tests execute, **Then** all feature components have tests covering key interactions
3. **Given** Svelte stores manage application state, **When** unit tests run for stores, **Then** all store actions and derived state are tested
4. **Given** helper utilities and transformers exist, **When** unit tests execute, **Then** all utility functions have tests with edge cases covered

---

### User Story 3 - Integration Tests for Data Layer (Priority: P2)

As a **backend developer**, I need **integration tests for the data abstraction layer** so that **I can verify Supabase service implementations work correctly and data transformations are accurate**.

**Why this priority**: The Project Status Review identifies missing data abstraction layer as a HIGH severity issue. Integration tests validate the service layer interacts correctly with Supabase and data flows properly.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running integration tests against a test Supabase database and verifying CRUD operations and relationships work correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** service interfaces are implemented (ProjectService, TaskService, TeamService), **When** integration tests execute CRUD operations, **Then** data is persisted and retrieved correctly from Supabase
2. **Given** data transformers convert between API and domain types, **When** integration tests run transformation scenarios, **Then** data shapes are correctly transformed in both directions
3. **Given** Row Level Security (RLS) policies are configured, **When** integration tests simulate different user permissions, **Then** users can only access data they have permissions for
4. **Given** many-to-many relationships exist (projects ↔ resources, outfits ↔ materials), **When** integration tests verify relationships, **Then** relationships are created and queried correctly

---

### User Story 4 - Important Workflow E2E Tests (Priority: P3)

As a **QA engineer**, I need **E2E tests for important workflows beyond critical journeys** so that **we can verify secondary features work correctly and maintain quality across the application**.

**Why this priority**: After critical journeys are tested (P1), important workflows provide additional coverage for MVP features like event planning, budget tracking, and resource management.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the extended E2E test suite and verifying all important workflow tests pass.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** convention planning features exist, **When** E2E tests simulate convention planning workflows, **Then** conventions can be discovered, planned, and linked to projects
2. **Given** photoshoot planning is implemented, **When** E2E tests run photoshoot scenarios, **Then** photoshoots can be created with crew, locations, and equipment
3. **Given** budget tracking features exist, **When** E2E tests simulate budget workflows, **Then** expenses can be added, tracked, and budget alerts work
4. **Given** character and moodboard management is implemented, **When** E2E tests verify these features, **Then** characters and moodboards can be created and linked to projects
5. **Given** calendar and timeline views exist, **When** E2E tests validate these features, **Then** events appear correctly and timelines display project milestones

---

### User Story 5 - Test Infrastructure & CI/CD Integration (Priority: P1)

As a **DevOps engineer** or **developer**, I need **test infrastructure that runs automatically on every commit** so that **we catch bugs early and maintain code quality throughout development**.

**Why this priority**: Automated testing in CI/CD is essential for maintaining quality and preventing broken code from reaching production. This is foundational infrastructure for all other testing.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by committing code changes and verifying tests run automatically, with results reported and failing tests blocking merges.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a CI/CD pipeline is configured, **When** a commit is pushed to any branch, **Then** unit tests run automatically and results are reported
2. **Given** E2E tests are configured, **When** a pull request is created, **Then** E2E tests run against a test environment and results block merge if tests fail
3. **Given** test coverage tracking is enabled, **When** tests complete, **Then** coverage reports are generated and coverage metrics are tracked
4. **Given** multiple test types exist (unit, E2E, integration), **When** tests run in CI/CD, **Then** tests run in parallel where possible to minimize pipeline duration
5. **Given** test failures occur, **When** tests fail in CI/CD, **Then** clear error messages and logs are provided to help developers debug issues

---

### Edge Cases

- E2E tests run against a persistent shared staging environment; if features are partially deployed, affected tests may fail until deployment completes - tests should be designed to handle graceful failures and provide clear error messages indicating incomplete deployments
- Flaky tests are auto-retried up to 3 times; if they pass on retry they are flagged for investigation and moved to a quarantine test suite to prevent blocking development while surfacing reliability issues
- What happens when test data conflicts with existing data in the test database?
- Tests use tiered timeouts: Unit tests timeout at 5 seconds, integration tests at 30 seconds, E2E tests at 2 minutes per test; warnings are issued at 80% threshold to identify slow tests before hard failures
- What happens when Supabase test database is down or unreachable during integration tests?
- How are test fixtures and seed data managed to ensure tests are reproducible?
- Concurrent test runs use separate database schemas/namespaces to prevent interference while sharing the same Supabase project

## Assumptions

1. **Test Environment**: A persistent shared staging environment is available and maintained (dedicated test Supabase project with schema isolation, long-running application deployment that stays up between test runs)
2. **CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions (or equivalent CI/CD platform) is configured and available
3. **Test Data**: Test data can be seeded and cleaned up without affecting production or development databases
4. **Browser Testing**: Playwright browsers can be installed and run in CI/CD environment
5. **Performance**: Test execution time is acceptable for development workflow (not blocking developers excessively)
6. **Maintenance**: Tests are treated as first-class code and maintained alongside features; visual regression snapshots for 60+ components will require regular review and updates when intentional UI changes are made
7. **Coverage Tools**: Code coverage tools (Vitest coverage, Playwright trace viewer) are available and configured
8. **Resource Availability**: Sufficient CI/CD minutes/resources are available for running comprehensive test suites including visual regression tests for all components

## Out of Scope (Post-MVP)

- **Performance Testing**: Load testing, stress testing, and performance benchmarking (Phase 3)
- **Security Testing**: Automated security scans, penetration testing (Phase 3)
- **Accessibility Testing**: Automated accessibility testing beyond basic checks (Phase 3)
- **API Contract Testing**: Comprehensive API contract tests (cover in integration tests initially)
- **Mutation Testing**: Advanced test quality validation (Phase 3)
- **Cross-Browser Testing Beyond Big 3**: Testing on older browsers or edge cases (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit sufficient for MVP)
- **Mobile Device Testing**: Real device testing (emulation sufficient for MVP)

## Dependencies

1. **Database Schema**: Complete database schema must be implemented before integration tests can be written (see Project Status Review - Critical Blocker #1)
2. **Data Abstraction Layer**: Service interfaces and transformers must be implemented before integration tests (see Project Status Review - Critical Blocker #2)
3. **MVP Features**: Features must be implemented before E2E tests can validate them (test-first approach means write tests, see them fail, then implement)
4. **Test Environment**: Persistent shared staging environment must be configured and maintained (test Supabase project with schema isolation, long-running application deployment)
5. **Playwright Configuration**: Playwright must be properly configured (already installed per Project Status Review)

## Implementation Phases

Per Constitution Principle IV (Test-First Approach), this feature should be implemented alongside MVP Core features:

1. **Phase 1 Foundation** (Week 1-2): Set up test infrastructure, CI/CD integration, test database, fixtures
2. **Phase 2 Critical Tests** (Week 3-6): Write E2E tests for critical user journeys AS features are being developed
3. **Phase 3 Component Tests** (Week 3-8): Write unit tests for components and stores as they are built
4. **Phase 4 Integration Tests** (Week 5-10): Write integration tests for data layer as services are implemented
5. **Phase 5 Important Workflows** (Week 7-12): Expand E2E coverage to important workflows
6. **Phase 6 Maintenance** (Ongoing): Maintain and update tests as features evolve

## Notes

- This specification aligns with Constitution v1.2.0, Principle IV (MVP First, Test-Driven Development - NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Test-first approach means: Write test → See it fail → Implement feature → See test pass
- Tests are documented in Phase 1-3 of Constitution Testing Strategy section
- This addresses Project Status Review Critical Blocker #3 (No E2E Tests - HIGH severity)
- Test infrastructure is foundational for all MVP development work

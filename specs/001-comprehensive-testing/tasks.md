# Tasks: Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-comprehensive-testing/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Constitution Compliance**: Tasks implement Constitution Principle IV (Test-First Development - NON-NEGOTIABLE) and address Critical Blocker #3 (No E2E Tests) from Project Status Review.

**Tests**: This feature IS the testing infrastructure - all tasks create tests that enable test-first development for other MVP features.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each test type.

- Critical Blocker #1: Database Schema Missing (from Project Status Review)
- Critical Blocker #2: Data Abstraction Layer Missing (from Project Status Review)

**Recommended approach**: Implement US1, US2, US4, US5 first. Once database schema and service layer exist, add US3.

### Within Each User Story

#### US5 (Infrastructure):
1. Configuration files (T008-T010) - parallel
2. SQL migrations (T011) - before database utilities (T012-T013)
3. Factories (T014-T020) - parallel
4. Fixtures & POMs (T021-T030) - parallel, after factories
5. Flaky detection (T031-T033) - parallel
6. Mocks (T034-T035) - parallel
7. CI/CD workflows (T036-T041) - parallel
8. Environment setup (T042-T045) - sequential (provision ‚Üí migrate ‚Üí configure ‚Üí deploy)
9. Documentation (T046-T047) - parallel

#### US1 (Critical E2E):
- All auth tests (T048-T051) - parallel
- All project tests (T052-T055) - parallel
- All task tests (T056-T058) - parallel
- All team tests (T059-T060) - parallel
- All resource tests (T061-T063) - parallel
- **All test files can run in parallel**

#### US2 (Component Unit):
- All base UI component tests (T064-T083) - parallel
- All feature component tests (T084-T093) - parallel
- All store tests (T094-T099) - parallel
- All utility tests (T100-T101) - parallel
- **All test files can run in parallel**

#### US3 (Integration):
- All service tests (T102-T107) - parallel
- All transformer tests (T108-T109) - parallel
- All RLS tests (T110-T112) - parallel
- **All test files can run in parallel**

#### US4 (Important E2E):
- All convention tests (T113-T115) - parallel

- All character/moodboard tests (T121-T122) - parallel
- All calendar/timeline tests (T123-T124) - parallel
- **All test files can run in parallel**

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: T001-T007 can all run in sequence (dependencies installed before scripts added)
- **Phase 2 (US5)**: Most tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (different files)
- **Phase 3-6 (US1, US2, US4)**: Once US5 completes, all three can start in parallel
- **Within each user story**: All [P] tasks (most test files) can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: US1 (Critical E2E Tests)

```bash
# After US5 (infrastructure) completes, launch all US1 tests in parallel:

# Authentication tests (parallel):
Task T048: "Create login test in tests/e2e/auth/login.spec.ts"
Task T049: "Create signup test in tests/e2e/auth/signup.spec.ts"
Task T050: "Create logout test in tests/e2e/auth/logout.spec.ts"
Task T051: "Create password reset test in tests/e2e/auth/password-reset.spec.ts"

# Project tests (parallel):
Task T052: "Create project creation test in tests/e2e/projects/create-project.spec.ts"
Task T053: "Create project view test in tests/e2e/projects/view-project.spec.ts"
Task T054: "Create project update test in tests/e2e/projects/update-project.spec.ts"
Task T055: "Create project archive test in tests/e2e/projects/archive-project.spec.ts"

# Task tests (parallel):
Task T056: "Create task creation test in tests/e2e/tasks/create-task.spec.ts"
Task T057: "Create task assignment test in tests/e2e/tasks/assign-task.spec.ts"

```

**All 16 test files can be created in parallel** - no dependencies between them.

## Parallel Example: US2 (Component Unit Tests)

```bash
# After US5 completes, launch all US2 tests in parallel:

# Base UI component tests (parallel - first 10 examples):
Task T064: "Create Button test in tests/unit/components/ui/Button.test.ts"
Task T065: "Create Card test in tests/unit/components/ui/Card.test.ts"
Task T066: "Create Input test in tests/unit/components/ui/Input.test.ts"
Task T067: "Create Select test in tests/unit/components/ui/Select.test.ts"
Task T068: "Create Checkbox test in tests/unit/components/ui/Checkbox.test.ts"
Task T069: "Create Radio test in tests/unit/components/ui/Radio.test.ts"
Task T070: "Create Modal test in tests/unit/components/ui/Modal.test.ts"
Task T071: "Create Dropdown test in tests/unit/components/ui/Dropdown.test.ts"
Task T072: "Create Tabs test in tests/unit/components/ui/Tabs.test.ts"
Task T073: "Create Alert test in tests/unit/components/ui/Alert.test.ts"
# ... (T074-T083 all parallel)

# Feature component tests (parallel):
Task T084: "Create ProjectCard test in tests/unit/components/ProjectCard.test.ts"
Task T085: "Create CharacterCreationForm test in tests/unit/components/CharacterCreationForm.test.ts"
# ... (T086-T093 all parallel)

# Store tests (parallel):
Task T094: "Create projects store test in tests/unit/stores/projects.test.ts"
Task T095: "Create tasks store test in tests/unit/stores/tasks.test.ts"
# ... (T096-T099 all parallel)
```

**All 38 test files can be created in parallel** - no dependencies between them.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Infrastructure + Critical Tests)

1. Complete **Phase 1: Setup** (install dependencies, create structure)
2. Complete **Phase 2: US5 - Infrastructure** (CRITICAL - blocks everything)
3. Complete **Phase 3: US1 - Critical E2E Tests** (P1 - highest value)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run `bun test:e2e tests/e2e/auth tests/e2e/projects tests/e2e/tasks tests/e2e/teams tests/e2e/resources` and verify all critical journeys pass
5. Deploy infrastructure to staging and validate CI/CD integration

**At this point**: MVP has test-first capability for critical user journeys (constitutional requirement satisfied).

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + US5 (Infrastructure) ‚Üí **Foundation ready for test-first development**
2. Add US1 (Critical E2E) ‚Üí **Can validate MVP features as they're built**
3. Add US2 (Component Unit) ‚Üí **Fast feedback during component development**
4. Add US4 (Important E2E) ‚Üí **Extended coverage for secondary features**
5. Add US3 (Integration) ‚Üí **Once database schema + services exist (external dependency)**
6. Each phase adds test coverage without breaking previous tests

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes **Setup (Phase 1)** together
2. Team completes **US5 (Infrastructure - Phase 2)** together - **MUST finish before splitting**
3. Once US5 is done, split work:
   - **Developer A**: US1 (Critical E2E Tests) - 16 test files
   - **Developer B**: US2 (Component Unit Tests) - 38 test files
   - **Developer C**: US4 (Important E2E Tests) - 12 test files
4. US3 (Integration Tests) can start once external dependencies (schema + services) are ready

**Estimated effort**:
- Phase 1 (Setup): 1-2 hours
- Phase 2 (US5 - Infrastructure): 2-3 days (1 developer) or 1-2 days (team)
- Phase 3 (US1 - Critical E2E): 3-5 days (1 developer)
- Phase 4 (US2 - Component Unit): 5-8 days (1 developer)
- Phase 5 (US3 - Integration): 3-5 days (1 developer) - **blocked by external dependencies**
- Phase 6 (US4 - Important E2E): 2-4 days (1 developer)
- Phase 7 (Visual Regression): 1-2 days (1 developer)
- Phase 8 (Polish): 1 day

**Total**: ~4-6 weeks (1 developer) or ~2-3 weeks (team of 3 working in parallel)

---

## Task Summary

### Total Tasks: 140

**By Phase**:
- Phase 1 (Setup): 7 tasks
- Phase 2 (US5 - Infrastructure): 40 tasks
- Phase 3 (US1 - Critical E2E): 16 tasks
- Phase 4 (US2 - Component Unit): 38 tasks
- Phase 5 (US3 - Integration): 11 tasks
- Phase 6 (US4 - Important E2E): 12 tasks
- Phase 7 (Visual Regression): 3 tasks
- Phase 8 (Polish): 13 tasks

**By Priority**:
- P1 (MVP): 63 tasks (Setup + US5 + US1 + partial US2)
- P2: 49 tasks (remaining US2 + US3 + Visual Regression)
- P3: 12 tasks (US4)
- Polish: 13 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 115+ tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phase

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] labels**: Map tasks to user stories for traceability
- **External blockers**: US3 (Integration Tests) blocked until database schema and service layer exist (Critical Blockers #1 and #2 from Project Status Review)
- **Test-first approach**: This infrastructure enables test-first development for all MVP features
- **Constitutional compliance**: Addresses Principle IV (Test-First Development) and Critical Blocker #3 (No E2E Tests)
- **Incremental value**: Each phase delivers testable value independently
- **Commit frequently**: Commit after completing each task or logical group
- **Stop at checkpoints**: Validate each phase independently before proceeding

# Specification Quality Checklist: MVP Cosplay Tracker Redesign

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 30, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed:

1. **Content Quality**: Specification is written from user perspective, focuses on what/why rather than how, and uses business language throughout. Technical notes are clearly separated at the end.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: 
   - All 75 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
   - 15 success criteria defined with specific measurable outcomes
   - 8 user stories with complete acceptance scenarios
   - 10 edge cases identified
   - Clear scope boundaries with "Out of Scope" section
   - 12 assumptions documented
   - No clarification markers remain

3. **Feature Readiness**: 
   - Each user story includes multiple acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
   - User stories prioritized (P1-P3) and independently testable
   - Success criteria are measurable (time-based, percentage-based, count-based)
   - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of specific frameworks or tools)
   - Complete workflow covered from idea capture through photoshoot planning

## Notes

- Specification is comprehensive and ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- Technical notes section included at end for planning reference but kept separate from user-facing requirements
- Team collaboration feature successfully integrated per user request
- Architecture patterns documented for consistent implementation approach

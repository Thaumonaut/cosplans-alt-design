# Tasks: MVP Cosplay Tracker Redesign

**Input**: Design documents from `/home/jek/Downloads/cosplay-tracker/specs/002-mvp-redesign/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Constitution Compliance**: ‚úÖ All tasks implement features per `.specify/memory/constitution.md` principles:
- **Project-Centric**: All cosplay features associable with projects (US1-US5)
- **Team-Based**: All content scoped to teams via RLS (US6)
- **MVP First**: P1 stories (US1, US2) constitute minimal viable product
- **Flowbite First**: Using Flowbite Svelte per constitutional requirement
- **Test-First**: Leveraging existing test infrastructure (spec 001), manual testing acceptable for MVP

**Tests**: Per constitution, manual testing is acceptable for MVP phase. E2E tests will be added incrementally using existing Playwright infrastructure from spec 001.

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)

- **User Stories (Phase 3-10)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - P1 stories (US1, US2) are MVP - complete before P2/P3 stories
  - P2 stories (US3, US4, US5, US6) can proceed in parallel after MVP validation
  - P3 stories (US7, US8) can proceed in parallel after P2 stories
- **Polish (Phase 11)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

**MVP (Must Complete First)**:
- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - Minimal dependency on US1 (idea conversion feature links to projects)

**Post-MVP (Incremental)**:
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - US2 already creates basic resource linking, US3 expands with full library and polymorphic fields
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Fully independent of other stories
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Minimal dependency on US2 (links to projects)
- **User Story 6 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Enhances all previous stories with team collaboration (requires personal team creation in signup)
- **User Story 7 (P3)**: Depends on US2 (projects) and US5 (photoshoots) for calendar events
- **User Story 8 (P3)**: Fully independent - can start after Foundational

### Within Each User Story

1. Services before stores
2. Stores before UI components
3. Base components before domain components
4. Domain components before pages
5. List pages before detail pages
6. Core functionality before edge cases

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: T004, T005, T006, T007 can run in parallel
**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 
- Migrations T011-T018 can run in parallel (after T010)
- Type files T029 can run in parallel (after T028)
- Base components T035-T042 can run in parallel

**Phase 3 (US1)**: T043, T044, T045 can run in parallel

**Phase 4 (US2)**: T054-T064 can run in parallel (services, stores, components)

**Phase 5 (US3)**: T079, T080 can run in parallel

**Phase 6 (US4)**: T096, T097 can run in parallel

**Phase 7 (US5)**: T106-T109 can run in parallel

**Phase 8 (US6)**: T122, T123, T124 can run in parallel

**Phase 9 (US7)**: T143 independent

**Phase 10 (US8)**: T152, T153 can run in parallel

**Phase 11 (Polish)**: Many tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

**Cross-Story Parallelization**: After Foundational (Phase 2), multiple user stories can be developed in parallel by different team members.

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Ideas)

```bash
# After Foundational phase completes, launch US1 in parallel:
Task T043: "Create ideaService in src/lib/api/services/ideaService.ts"
Task T044: "Create ideas store in src/lib/stores/ideas.ts"
Task T045: "Create IdeaCard component in src/lib/components/cards/IdeaCard.svelte"

# Then sequentially:
Task T046: "Create ideas board list page" (depends on T043, T044, T045)
Task T047: "Implement fuzzy search for ideas" (depends on T046)
# ... etc
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T009)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T010-T042) - CRITICAL blocking phase
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - Ideas (T043-T053)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 independently (capture ideas, search with typos, convert to project)
5. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 - Projects (T054-T078)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US2 independently (create project, link resources, track tasks/budget/progress)
7. **MVP COMPLETE**: Deploy and gather user feedback on core idea-to-project workflow

**MVP Deliverables**:
- ‚úÖ Capture and manage cosplay ideas with images and difficulty estimates
- ‚úÖ Convert ideas to projects seamlessly
- ‚úÖ Track project progress with hybrid task/resource calculation
- ‚úÖ Manage resources with basic linking (full polymorphic library in US3)
- ‚úÖ Budget tracking with overspend warnings
- ‚úÖ Fuzzy search with typo tolerance
- ‚úÖ Single-user personal team (multi-team in US6)

### Incremental Delivery (Post-MVP)

1. Add User Story 3: Resource Library (T079-T095) ‚Üí Polymorphic resource management
2. Add User Story 4: Tools Management (T096-T105) ‚Üí Equipment tracking
3. Add User Story 5: Photoshoots (T106-T121) ‚Üí Complete workflow: idea ‚Üí project ‚Üí shoot
4. Add User Story 6: Team Collaboration (T122-T142) ‚Üí Multi-user projects and permissions
5. Add User Story 7: Calendar (T143-T151) ‚Üí Timeline visualization
6. Add User Story 8: Settings (T152-T160) ‚Üí Personalization
7. Complete Phase 11: Polish (T161-T186) ‚Üí Final touches and edge cases

Each story adds value without breaking previous stories.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Team completes Setup + Foundational together** (Phases 1-2)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Ideas)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Projects - can start basic project CRUD in parallel, add resource linking after US1 completes idea conversion)
3. After MVP validation:
   - Developer A: User Story 3 (Resources) + User Story 4 (Tools)
   - Developer B: User Story 5 (Photoshoots)
   - Developer C: User Story 6 (Teams)
4. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Constitutional Compliance Checklist

**Verified Throughout Tasks**:

- ‚úÖ **Project-Centric**: US1-US5 all associable with projects (ideas convert to projects, resources/tools/photoshoots link to projects)
- ‚úÖ **Team-Based**: All content scoped to teams via RLS (T010-T018 migrations, US6 team collaboration)
- ‚úÖ **MVP First**: P1 stories (US1-US2) clearly marked as MVP, P2/P3 incremental
- ‚úÖ **Test-First**: Leveraging existing Playwright/Vitest infrastructure (spec 001), manual testing for MVP per constitution
- ‚úÖ **Modular**: Features organized by domain (Ideas, Projects, Resources, Tools, Photoshoots, Teams, Calendar, Settings)
- ‚úÖ **Cost-Conscious**: Using free-tier Supabase, no paid services introduced
- ‚úÖ **Flowbite First**: All UI components use Flowbite Svelte (T006, T035-T042 base components)
- ‚úÖ **Future-Ready**: Polymorphic entities (resources, tools) support expansion without schema changes
- ‚úÖ **Data Privacy**: RLS policies on all tables (T010-T018), team-based access control (US6)
- ‚úÖ **Tech Stack**: SvelteKit 2.x, Svelte 5 (runes), Flowbite Svelte, Supabase, Bun (T001-T009)

**No Constitutional Violations Found** ‚úÖ

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label (US1-US8) maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Manual testing is acceptable for MVP per constitution (automated tests can be added incrementally)
- Commit after each task or logical group for rollback safety
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently before proceeding
- All paths use absolute references per plan.md structure
- Flowbite Svelte components used throughout per constitutional requirement
- Image processing uses 3 variants (thumbnail 200px, display 2MB, original) per research.md
- Fuzzy search uses Fuse.js with threshold 0.3 for typo tolerance per clarifications
- Progress calculation uses hybrid approach (tasks + resource status + resource tasks) per FR-008
- On-blur auto-save pattern used throughout per clarifications (US1 acceptance scenario 4)

**Total Tasks**: 186
- Setup: 9 tasks
- Foundational: 33 tasks
- User Story 1 (P1 MVP): 11 tasks

**MVP Scope**: 78 tasks (Setup + Foundational + US1 + US2)
**Full Implementation**: 186 tasks

**Suggested Start**: Complete MVP first (Phases 1-4, tasks T001-T078), validate with users, then incrementally add P2 and P3 features based on feedback.

# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Verify compliance with `.specify/memory/constitution.md`:

- [ ] **Project-Centric**: Feature is associable with projects (or explain if project-agnostic utility)
- [ ] **Team-Based**: Feature respects team ownership and membership boundaries
- [ ] **Feature Scope**: Feature is classified in Feature Scope Matrix (MVP Core, Phase 2, Phase 3, or Future)
- [ ] **Complete Workflow**: Feature supports a clear phase of the cosplay lifecycle (ideation → creation → event → post-production → archive)
- [ ] **MVP First**: Scope is minimal viable; complex features justified or deferred
- [ ] **Test-First**: Critical user journeys have tests written before implementation
- [ ] **Modular**: Feature fits cleanly into one domain (Main/Tracking/Social/Events/Resources)
- [ ] **Cost-Conscious**: No new paid services introduced without justification
- [ ] **Future-Ready**: Data models accommodate planned enhancements without over-engineering
- [ ] **Data Privacy**: Privacy levels and data ownership respected (Supabase RLS)
- [ ] **Tech Stack**: Uses SvelteKit, Bun, Flowbite, Tailwind, Supabase, Cloudflare (or justifies deviation)
- [ ] **Navigation**: If adding routes, aligns with documented navigation structure

**Feature Phase**: [MVP Core | Phase 2 | Phase 3 | Future | New - requires amendment]

**Violations**: [List any constitutional violations and justification, or "None"]

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
